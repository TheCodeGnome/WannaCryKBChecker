# WannaCryKBChecker
A simple commandline script to verify WannaCry related KBs are present and status of affected ports.

## PLEASE NOTE
This script does not check for infection or even possible infection. It merely checks for the KBs in your updates and checks the status of four ports. You must check the output (wannaCry.txt) and read the results to ensure the KBs installed correctly.

Please remember to regularly update your devices.
